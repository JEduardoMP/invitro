## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **SASS**: For styling components.
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing.
- **ESLint**: For code linting and quality assurance.

## AI Usage

AI tools were used to assist in the development of this application, including:

- Generating boilerplate code for components and configurations.
- Suggesting improvements to TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Providing styling suggestions for SASS modules.

### Limitations of AI Usage

- AI-generated code may require manual adjustments to align with specific project requirements.
- Some edge cases or complex scenarios may not be fully addressed by AI-generated solutions.
- Styling and design choices may need refinement to meet user experience standards.

## Known Limitations

- The application currently does not support user authentication.
- Appointment data is stored in memory and will be lost on page refresh.
- No backend integration for persistent data storage.

## Next Steps

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Integrate a backend service for storing doctor and appointment data.
- Add unit and integration tests for better reliability.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more responsive and accessible design.
- Support localization for multiple languages.
